Tu paras piensar que necesitas vestir sombreros y empiezas so√±ar de invierno a nuevo.\nL‚ÄôHOMME QUI AIMAIT LES ASCENSEURS Harry attendait l‚Äôascenseur devant l‚Äôimmeuble. Au moment o√π la porte s‚Äôouvrit, il entendit derri√®re lui une voix de femme : ¬´ Une seconde, s‚Äôil vous pla√Æt. ¬ª Elle entra et la porte se referma. Elle √©tait v√™tue d‚Äôune robe jaune, ses cheveux √©taient ramen√©s sur sa t√™te et de ridicules boucles d‚Äôoreilles en perles se balan√ßaient au bout de cha√Ænes d‚Äôargent. Elle avait un gros cul et elle √©tait forte. Elle √©clatait de partout dans cette robe jaune, seins et tout. Ses yeux √©taient du vert le plus p√¢le et le transper√ßaient. Elle tenait un sac rempli de provisions marqu√© Vons. Ses l√®vres √©taient barbouill√©es de rouge. Peintes, √©paisses, elles √©taient obsc√®nes, presque laides, une v√©ritable insulte. Le rouge √† l√®vres vermillon luisait et Harry appuya sur le bouton ARR√äT.\nL‚Äôascenseur s‚Äôarr√™ta. Harry s‚Äôapprocha d‚Äôelle. Il lui souleva sa robe et regarda ses jambes. Elle avait des jambes incroyables, tout en chair et en muscles. Elle paraissait frapp√©e de stupeur. Il la saisit et elle l√¢cha son sac. Des bo√Ætes de l√©gumes, un avocat, du papier toilette, de la viande pr√©emball√©e et trois barres de chocolat roul√®rent sur le plancher. Il plaqua sa bouche contre la sienne. Ses l√®vres s‚Äôentrouvrirent. Il lui souleva de nouveau sa robe. Sa bouche toujours sur la sienne, il lui baissa sa culotte. Puis il la prit l√†, debout, en la faisant rebondir contre la paroi de la cabine. Quand il eut fini, il remonta sa fermeture √âclair, appuya sur le bouton du deuxi√®me √©tage et attendit en lui tournant le dos. La porte s‚Äôouvrit et il descendit. L‚Äôascenseur repartit.\nIl arriva devant son appartement, glissa la clef dans la serrure et ouvrit. Sa femme, Rochelle, √©tait dans la cuisine o√π elle pr√©parait le d√Æner.\n‚Äî Bonne journ√©e ? demanda-t-elle.\n‚Äî Chiante, comme d‚Äôhabitude, r√©pondit-il.\n‚Äî On mange dans dix minutes, dit-elle.\nHarry alla dans la salle de bain, se d√©barrassa de ses v√™tements et prit une douche. Il commen√ßait √† en avoir marre de son boulot. Six ans et il n‚Äôavait pas un sou √† la banque. C‚Äô√©tait comme √ßa qu‚Äôils vous pi√©geaient ‚Äì ils vous donnaient juste assez pour survivre, mais jamais de quoi vous permettre de vous √©chapper.\nIl se savonna soigneusement, se rin√ßa, et laissa l‚Äôeau tr√®s chaude couler sur sa nuque. Elle emporta la fatigue. Il s‚Äôessuya, passa son peignoir, entra dans la cuisine et s‚Äôassit √† table. Rochelle √©tait en train de servir. Des boulettes de viande avec de la sauce. Rochelle faisait d‚Äôexcellentes boulettes de viande avec de l‚Äôexcellente sauce.\n‚Äî Et si tu m‚Äôannon√ßais de bonnes nouvelles ? fit-il.\n‚Äî De bonnes nouvelles ?\n‚Äî Tu sais tr√®s bien de quoi je parle.\n‚Äî Mes r√®gles ?\n‚Äî Oui.\n‚Äî Je ne les ai toujours pas.\n‚Äî Merde.\n‚Äî Le caf√© n‚Äôest pas pr√™t.\n‚Äî Tu oublies tout le temps.\n‚Äî C‚Äôest vrai. Et je ne sais pas pourquoi.\nRochelle s‚Äôinstalla et ils commenc√®rent √† manger, sans caf√©. Les boulettes de viande √©taient excellentes.\n‚Äî Harry, dit-elle. Je pourrais me faire avorter.\n‚Äî Bon, dit-il. Si √ßa en arrive l√†, c‚Äôest ce qu‚Äôon fera.\nLe lendemain soir, il prit l‚Äôascenseur tout seul. Il monta au deuxi√®me et sortit. Puis il fit demi-tour et redescendit. Il emprunta l‚Äôall√©e et attendit dans sa voiture. Il la vit arriver, cette fois sans sac de provisions. Il ouvrit sa porti√®re.\nAujourd‚Äôhui, elle avait une robe rouge, plus courte et plus moulante que la jaune. Elle avait les cheveux d√©faits. Ils √©taient tr√®s longs et lui tombaient presque jusqu‚Äôaux fesses. Elle avait les m√™mes ridicules boucles d‚Äôoreilles et ses l√®vres √©taient encore plus barbouill√©es de rouge que la veille. Elle entra dans l‚Äôascenseur et il entra derri√®re elle. La cabine s‚Äô√©leva et il appuya de nouveau sur ARR√äT. Aussit√¥t il fut sur elle, ses l√®vres sur cette bouche rouge et obsc√®ne. Elle n‚Äôavait toujours pas de collants, juste des chaussettes rouges qui lui arrivaient aux genoux. Harry lui baissa son slip et la p√©n√©tra. Ils rebondirent contre les quatre parois. Cette fois, √ßa dura plus longtemps. Puis Harry remonta sa fermeture √âclair, lui tourna le dos et pressa le bouton du deuxi√®me √©tage.\nEn ouvrant la porte, il entendit Rochelle chanter. Elle avait une voix atroce et il se d√©p√™cha d‚Äôaller prendre sa douche. Il sortit en peignoir, s‚Äôassit √† table.\n‚Äî Merde, fit-il. Ils ont licenci√© quatre types aujourd‚Äôhui, m√™me Jim Bronson.\n‚Äî C‚Äôest moche, fit Rochelle.\nIl y avait des steaks avec des frites, de la salade avec des cro√ªtons. Pas mauvais.\n‚Äî Tu sais depuis combien de temps Jim √©tait l√† ?\n‚Äî Non.\n‚Äî Cinq ans.\nRochelle ne dit rien.\n‚Äî Cinq ans, reprit ‚Ä¶","date":1649289600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1649289600,"objectID":"64318d6efe917d72b2beb3abe8623a8f","permalink":"https://horhik.github.io/post/first_days_of_april/","publishdate":"2022-04-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/first_days_of_april/","section":"post","summary":"I WAS REALLY SUPRISED SEARIOSLY, IT‚ÄôS APRIL OMG APRIL APRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRILAPRI—ä–£L\nI LOVE PRIMAVERA\nMe gusta primavera.
